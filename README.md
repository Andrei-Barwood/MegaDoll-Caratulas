## üé® Philosophy

As the author of Mega Doll, I embrace an open-minded approach to creative collaboration. This repository functions as a Community Modification System (CMS) ‚Äî a living extension of the entire Mega Doll ecosystem. Here, modification isn‚Äôt just welcome; it‚Äôs encouraged.
The guiding principle is simple yet profound: be creative, but more importantly, be sincere. Say what matters and always tell the truth.

## On DLCs and Lost Catalogs

I wholeheartedly encourage DLC (downloadable content) development for both future and recent Mega Doll releases. Unfortunately, our original catalog has been irretrievably lost, and with it, previous DLCs have vanished into the digital ether. There are currently no plans to recover this lost content ‚Äî sometimes we must accept what‚Äôs gone and focus our energy on what‚Äôs yet to come.
